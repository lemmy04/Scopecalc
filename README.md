# Scopecalc is an android app to figure out the longest and shortest "sensible" eye pieces for an astronomical telescope,
based on the telescope's aprture and focal lenght.
The assumption used in the calculation is that the exit pupil of a telescope should never be bigger than 7mm, or smaller than 0.5mm.
